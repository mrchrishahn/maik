We’re hiring a freelance advisor for our product development. They should provide us with insights on specific research topics within their area of expertise. If needed they are supposed to do some research to be able to answer our questions. The contract is meant to run for the duration of our product development (we don’t know how long that will be). We want them to be available in a kind of “on-call” way.
