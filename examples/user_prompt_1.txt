I am the founder of a small digital signage business in Berlin. So far it is just me and my co-founder. Rather than using third-party software we want to explore creating software ourselves that can be used to show media on digital billboards. For this we want to hire a freelance engineer to see if this idea holds any merit before committing to full time employees. Since I have no clue at all of German contract law I would like to have your support in drafting this contract and making sure I have all my bases covered.
