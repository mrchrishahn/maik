I’m working on an MVP for a new app idea and want to bring in a freelance developer for a few months to build the prototype. We’ll be using a tech stack I’m defining, and I want to make sure everything they write belongs to me and that there are no legal issues later. I also want to make sure I’m not accidentally creating an employment relationship. Can you help me draft a proper freelance contract that covers IP, timelines, payment milestones, and includes the usual legal boilerplate?
