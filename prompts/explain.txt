Write a ≤150-word note in plain English:

• One sentence on what this contract is for.
• What each side promises (3 short bullets).
• The big choices we set: who owns the work, the maximum payout if things go wrong (the “cap”), and how either side can end the deal.
• What’s still missing (list [PLACEHOLDER]s) and any attachments to add.
• How to finish: we’ll send our draft now; then collect the other side’s comments, agree changes, and sign.

End with: “Want it stricter or more flexible? Say which part: ownership, cap, or ending the deal.”
