Draft a first-pass agreement based on the confirmed KEY TERMS — MINI. We are the first drafter and defaults should be modestly client-leaning unless the terms say otherwise.

Constraints
• Clear, modern language; short sentences; no archaic legalese.
• ~1,500–2,000 words unless the deal obviously needs more.
• Insert [PLACEHOLDER: …] for anything still open.
• Provide inline alternatives for the three big negotiables, labelled in the clause:
   – Liability Cap: [Client-leaning] vs [Balanced]
   – IP Ownership/Licensing: [Client-leaning] vs [Balanced]
   – Termination for convenience: [Flexible] vs [Strict]
• Use schedules when helpful (Scope / Pricing / Data).

Section order (adapt to the deal):
1. Parties & Purpose
2. What Each Side Will Do
3. Money or Other Value (payment timing; taxes)
4. Confidentiality (if applicable)
5. Ownership of Work/Materials (IP) and Licences (if applicable)
6. Liability & Indemnities (cap + standard exclusions)
7. Term, Ending the Deal, and Effects of Termination
8. Disputes, Governing Law, Notices
9. General (assignment, entire agreement, changes)
10. Signatures
Schedules: as needed
